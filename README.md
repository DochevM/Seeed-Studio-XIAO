# Seeed-Studio-XIAO
The [Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/), which used to be named Seeeduino XIAO, is the first debut of the Seeed Studio XIAO family, a series of powerful thumb-size dev boards compatible with Arduino. It carries the powerful ATSAMD21G18A-MU which is a low-power microcontroller. On the other hand, this little board has good performance in processing but needs less power. It is designed in a tiny size and can be used for wearable devices and small projects. Key features include:

- Powerful CPU: ARM® Cortex®-M0+ 32bit 48MHz microcontroller(SAMD21G18) with 256KB Flash,32KB SRAM.
- Flexible compatibility: Compatible with Arduino IDE.
- Easy project operation: Breadboard-friendly.
- Small size: As small as a thumb(20x17.5mm) for wearable devices and small projects.
- Multiple development interfaces: 11 digital/analog pins, 10 PWM Pins, 1 DAC output, 1 SWD Bonding pad interface, 1 I2C interface, 1 UART interface, 1 SPI interface.

# SAMD21

 SAMD21 is a series of low-power microcontrollers using the 32-bit ARM® Cortex® -M0+ processor, and ranging from 32- to 64-pins with up to 256KB Flash and 32KB of SRAM. The SAM D21 devices operate at a maximum frequency of 48MHz and reach 2.46 CoreMark® /MHz. They are designed for simple and intuitive migration with identical peripheral modules, hex compatible code, identical linear address map and pin compatible migration paths between all devices in the product series. Key features:
